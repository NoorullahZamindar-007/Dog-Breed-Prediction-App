# 🐾 Dog Breed Prediction App

The Dog Breed Prediction App is a Flask-based web application that predicts the breed of a dog from an uploaded image. The application utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to accurately identify the breed of a dog from a given image and display the predicted breed with the confidence score.
